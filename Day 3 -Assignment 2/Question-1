Question:

const clothes = ['jacket', 't-shirt'];
clothes.length = 0;
console.log(clothes[0]);

Answer:

The console will give "Undefined", because when the line 9 when will get executed, all the items of the array "clothes" will be deleted.
It will give "Undefined" because the clothes array was emptied by Line 9 "length" property.
